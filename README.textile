This tool adds basic protection to server against DoS/DDoS through HTTP.

Tool is designed to use:

* Linux
* tmpfs (for speedup)
* sqlite3
* ruby

Required ruby gems:

* activesupport
* daemons
* sqlite3-ruby
* file-tail

Well, as it starts and tries to mount ./db with tmpfs (ability and size of tmpfs are setting up in config) to boost speed.
And it is actually needed step, cause heavy working with sqlite3 increases disk activity a lot.

That it "tails" logfile (looking for new records each 10 seconds) and adds records to sqlite3.

During adding it increases counter for same requests in last 10 seconds. More than 10 same requests from same IP looks suspicious,
so its going to be banned using external command.

Example log formats:

:common => '%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b',
:common_with_virtual => '%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b',
:combined => '%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"',
:combined_with_virtual => '%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"',
:combined_with_cookies => '%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\" \"%{Cookies}i\"'

'h' => :ip
'l' => :auth
'u' => :username
't' => :datetime
'r' => :request
's' => :status
'b' => :bytecount
'v' => :domain
'i' => :header_lines


Any help and assistance on improving this stuff will be appreciated.
